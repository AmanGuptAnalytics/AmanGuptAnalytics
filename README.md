# ***Hello folks*** üòä
Hope you are doing good.

I'm a dynamic data and analytics engineer with the ability to deliver short or long-term projects in data engineering, data warehousing and the business intelligence realm. My mission is to enable and improve the data usage and analytics capabilities of my stakeholders. I wish to partner with my clients to deliver top-notch, scalable data solutions to provide immediate and lasting value.


I specialize in the following data solutions:

‚úîÔ∏è Consulting on your data strategy  
‚úîÔ∏è Building data warehouses using modern cloud platforms and technologies  
‚úîÔ∏è Creating and automating data pipelines & ETL processes  
‚úîÔ∏è Building highly intuitive, interactive dashboards  
‚úîÔ∏è Data Cleaning and Processing  
‚úîÔ∏è Data Migration

A bit of **BIO**:

-   After seven years in civil engineering, I understood that data is at the core of each successful project.
-   Along with a handful of experience in ad-hoc analytics concerning civil engineering projects, I was actively involved in learning data engineering part-time.
-   I am now able to do end-to-end modern analytics, starting with data ingestion pipelines, data warehouses, dashboards and basic statistics. Combined with my project management soft skills, this enables me to bring technical improvements and positive change to an organisation.
