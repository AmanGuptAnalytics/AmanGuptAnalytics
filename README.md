# Hello Folks üòä
Hope you are doing good.

I am a Data Enthusiast and love (‚ù§Ô∏è) the data engineering and BI side of data. I am transitioning from Civil Engineering to Data Engineering and started about a year back. With dozens of courses finished, this is my  GitHub repo containing several data engineering and analytics projects. I Have also done some freelancing. Details are  on [resume](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GtnjfnNVAqvnVOV52VTbBd2OW3i-Ez2X/view?usp=sharing). 

Here's my **MISSION**:

My mission is to enable and improve the data usage and analytics capabilities of my stakeholders.


A bit of **BIO**:

-   After seven years in civil engineering, I understood that data is at the core of each successful project.
-   Along with a handful of experience in ad-hoc analytics concerning civil engineering projects, I was actively involved in learning data engineering part-time.
-   I am now able to do end-to-end modern analytics, starting with data ingestion pipelines, data warehouses, dashboards and basic statistics. Combined with my project management soft skills, this enables me to bring technical improvements and positive change to an organisation.
